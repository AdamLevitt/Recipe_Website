    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is an unbelievably delicious and quick salmon recipe. You can play
      around with the ingredients: add fresh basil leaves instead of the chili
      or balsamic instead of the lemon juice. The wholegrain mustard is
      essential. You are guaranteed to love this one! Serve with a green salad,
      and enjoy!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 garlic gloves</li>
      <li>1 dried red chile pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon whole grain mustard</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
      <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>2 (6 ounce) fillets salmon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a medium baking dish
        with aluminum foil. Lightly grease foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a mortar and pestle, grind together the garlic, chile pepper, and
        olive oil. Mix into a thick paste with the mustard, lime juice, salt,
        and pepper. Place the salmon fillets in the prepared baking dish, and
        coat with the paste mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake salmon 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is
        easily flaked with a fork.
      </li>
    </ol>
